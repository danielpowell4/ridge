# Ridge

Beyond few `VLOOKUP`s, a `SUM` and an `AVERAGE`, using excel becomes a hassle. Understanding a data's shape shouldn't be.

In dreamworld, this project is to evolve into a series of boilerplate components that make time to insight adequately "easy" or at least enjoyable.

This project now exists inside a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) mindset. Pages go in pages. Components goes into components.
