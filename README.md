# Ridge

Finding insights into data shouldnâ€™t be difficult. Users should only need to answer a few questions.

Ridge, a data data-oriented side project of mine, is intended to supply boilerplate components for data vis and understanding.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## View in action

After pulling down the project directory and cding on in, you can run `yarn (install)` and then:

`yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn test`
Runs test suite, which is currently (very) limited
