#Ridge
Finding insights into data shouldnâ€™t be difficult. Users should only need to answer a few questions. **Ridge**, a data interaction application, does the heavy lifting and serve you an interactive chart with clear tooltips and sorting features in near real time. No SQL needed for users. Setup, of course, is required.

Note: This project is currently under construction.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
